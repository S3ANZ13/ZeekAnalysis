abstract = {Packet analysis is a primary traceback technique in network forensics, which, providing that the packet details captured are sufficiently detailed, can play back even the entire network traffic for a particular point in time. This can be used to find traces of nefarious online behavior, data breaches, unauthorized website access, malware infection, and intrusion attempts, and to reconstruct image files, documents, email attachments, etc. sent over the network. This paper is a comprehensive survey of the utilization of packet analysis, including deep packet inspection, in network forensics, and provides a review of AI-powered packet analysis methods with advanced network traffic classification and pattern identification capabilities. Considering that not all network information can be used in court, the types of digital evidence that might be admissible are detailed. The properties of both hardware appliances and packet analyzer software are reviewed from the perspective of their potential use in network forensics.}

abstract = {Monitoring tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Firewalls, or Honeypots are a second line of defense in the face of an increasing number of distributed, increasingly sophisticated, and targeted attacks. A huge amount of security alerts needs to be analyzed and correlated to gather the complete picture of an attack. However, most conventional IDS fall short in correlating alerts that have different sources, so that many distributed attacks remain completely unnoticed. In this paper, we define alert correlation as a process and describe the consecutive steps along with their properties and goals. Following this process, we propose Graph-based Alert Correlation (GAC), a novel correlation algorithm that isolates attacks, identifies attack scenarios, and assembles multi-stage attacks from huge alert sets. Our evaluation results on artificial and real-world data indicates that GAC is robust against false positives, can detect distributed attacks, and scales with an increasing number of alerts.},
